I would like to implement a series of changes to the current codebase. I want you to first draft an implementation plan. Please consult the last implementation summary in /docs/VERSION_5.0.0_SUMMARY and the .clinerules before starting. Specifically I want to change the current network visualization and create new options and approaches for the keyword extraction in the Website → Noun network creation. Please re-use as much as possible from the codebase of this other library: https://github.com/dimelab/some2net/.

- Use Graphology as the main visualization library and scrap the current version. Make the implementation as close as possible to how it is done in https://github.com/dimelab/some2net
- The user should have additional options for how to extract keywords from websites. It should be possible to specify if the user wants just nouns or all potential keywords. There should be a choice between using either TF-IDF or a RAKE based approach. For both it should be possible to specify maximum number of keywords to be extracted. The TF-IDF should also have an option to include bigrams and RAKE should also specify how large n-grams to include. Furthermore the TF-IDF option should make it possible to specify how sensitive the ranking should be to the IDF rather than the TF. Again please re-use as much as possible from https://github.com/dimelab/some2net.
- In addition to Website → Noun there should also be a Website → NER (named entity recognition) which should work with both english and Danish. Again please copy as much as possible from the implementation in https://github.com/dimelab/some2net including all user settings.

Please output the implementation plan as an .md file before commencing with making the changes.

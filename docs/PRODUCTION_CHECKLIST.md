## Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

Monitor these metrics closely after deployment:

- [ ] Hour 1: No critical errors
- [ ] Hour 4: Performance stable
- [ ] Hour 8: All services healthy
- [ ] Hour 24: No security incidents
- [ ] Day 7: Long-term stability confirmed

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Stop incoming traffic (Nginx)
   - Investigate root cause
   - Check logs and metrics

2. **Rollback Steps:**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/issue-observatory
   git checkout [previous-version]
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback:**
   - Verify services healthy
   - Review incident
   - Document lessons learned

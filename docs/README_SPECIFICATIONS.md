# Issue Observatory Search - Technical Specifications

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive technical specifications addressing two critical gaps in the Issue Observatory Search project:

1. **LLM-based concept extraction** - Distilling high-level concepts from **full website text content**
2. **Network backboning** - Reducing network complexity while preserving structure

These specifications were created and updated on **October 22, 2025** to provide complete, production-ready implementation guidance for the development team.

**Important Update**: The LLM concept extraction approach processes the **full textual content** from all scraped pages of a website (not just noun phrases). This provides superior concept quality through complete context understanding. The specifications include text aggregation strategies, chunking/summarization for large websites, updated cost estimates (~165x higher but with better quality), and Ollama (local LLM) integration as a zero-cost fallback option.

|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Model** | GPT-4o-mini | 95% cheaper than GPT-4, 2-5s latency, excellent with full context |
| **Input** | **Full website text** | All pages aggregated, ~15K tokens average |
| **Fallback** | GPT-4o → Claude → **Ollama** → Clustering → Nouns | 5-stage graceful degradation with zero-cost local option |
| **Cost** | $0.0023/website | ~$23 per 1000 websites first run, $2.30 cached (90%) |
| **Caching** | Redis + Database | Content-hash based, 90%+ hit rate, 1-week TTL |
| **Performance** | 2-5s typical, 10-30s large | Cache hit: <50ms |

### Network Backboning

| Aspect | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Algorithm** | Disparity Filter | O(E) fast, statistically principled, validated |
| **Default α** | 0.05 | Standard significance level (95% confidence) |
| **Search-Website** | α=0.1 | Lenient for sparse networks |
| **Website-Noun** | α=0.05 | Standard filtering |
| **Website-Concept** | α=0.01-0.03 | Aggressive for dense networks |

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### LLM Costs (GPT-4o-mini)

| Scale | First Run | With 90% Cache | Monthly* |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 1,000 websites | $23 | $2.30 | $6-7 |
| 10,000 websites | $230 | $23 | $60-70 |
| 100,000 websites | $2,300 | $230 | $600-700 |

*Assuming 10% content change per week

**Cost Comparison**: ~165x more expensive than noun-based approach, but significantly better quality

**Ollama Alternative**: Zero API cost, requires GPU server ($50-200/month or one-time $500-2000 hardware)

**Infrastructure**: ~$25-225/month (Redis + storage + optional Ollama)

**Total**: $25-300/month for typical research usage (1K-10K websites)

### Backboning Costs

**Zero ongoing costs** - runs locally, one-time computation per network

## 🎓 Theoretical Background

### LLM Concept Extraction

**Task**: Transform list of noun phrases → abstract conceptual themes

**Approach**: Few-shot prompting with GPT-4o-mini
- Input: Top 50 TF-IDF weighted nouns from website
- Process: LLM identifies thematic clusters and abstracts to concepts
- Output: 3-7 high-level concepts (2-5 words each)

**Example**:
```
Input: klima, co2-udledning, vindenergi, solceller, bæredygtighed
Output:
  - Klimaforandringer og miljø
  - Vedvarende energikilder
  - Bæredygtig udvikling
```

**Quality**: Validated through relevance scores, human evaluation samples

### Network Backboning

**Problem**: Dense networks (10K+ edges) are hard to visualize and analyze

**Solution**: Statistical filtering to keep only significant edges

**Disparity Filter Theory**:
- Null hypothesis: Edge weights uniformly distributed among node's neighbors
- Test statistic: `α_ij = (1 - w_ij/Σw_i)^(k_i-1)`
- Decision: Keep edge if `α_ij < α` (default α=0.05)
- Interpretation: Edge is significant if weight is unusually high for that node

**Effect**:
- Removes 70-90% of edges
- Preserves 60-80% of total weight
- Maintains network structure and communities

**Validation**: Weight correlation >0.7, connectivity preservation >0.5

## 📊 Example Results

### Before Backboning (Website-Concept Network)

- Nodes: 500 websites
- Edges: 25,000
- Density: 0.20 (very dense)
- Average degree: 100
- Visualization: Unreadable "hairball"

### After Backboning (α=0.03)

- Nodes: 498 websites (2 isolated removed)
- Edges: 3,750 (85% reduction)
- Density: 0.03
- Average degree: 15
- Visualization: Clear structure, identifiable clusters
- Weight retention: 68%

**Result**: Readable network preserving key relationships

1. **Relevance score**: 0-1, semantic overlap with source nouns (target: >0.7)
2. **Concept count**: 2-10 per website (typical: 3-7)
3. **Distinctness**: No duplicates within same website
4. **Clarity**: Human-readable, 2-5 words

**Validation**: Random sample manual review (target: 85% approval)

### Backboning Quality

Measured by:
1. **Weight correlation**: 0-1, high-weight edge preservation (target: >0.7)
2. **Connectivity preservation**: 0-1, path maintenance (target: >0.5)
3. **Community similarity**: 0-1, structure preservation (target: >0.5)
4. **Reduction percentage**: 70-90% typical

**Validation**: Automated on every backboning operation

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### LLM Extraction

1. **Language support**: Optimized for English/Danish (others work but may need tuning)
2. **Domain specificity**: Generic prompts (could specialize per research domain)
3. **Latency**: 1-3s per website (fine for batch, not real-time)
4. **Cost scaling**: Linear with content volume

### Backboning

1. **Parameter sensitivity**: α may need tuning for specific domains
2. **Very large graphs**: >1M edges may need chunking
3. **Bipartite structure**: Works well but could be optimized further

### None are blockers - all have workarounds documented in specs

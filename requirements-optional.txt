# ===========================
# PyTorch & Sentence Transformers - For LLM Features (FUTURE)
# ===========================
# NOT NEEDED for current application functionality
# Only needed if implementing Phase 5: LLM Concept Extraction (not yet implemented)
#
# WARNING: PyTorch is very large (~2GB download, 800MB+ installed)
#
# Install only if you plan to add LLM-based concept extraction:
# torch==2.1.2
# sentence-transformers==2.2.2
#
# Or use GPU-accelerated version (NVIDIA GPU required):
# Install from: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# torch==2.1.2+cu118  # CUDA 11.8
# torch==2.1.2+cu121  # CUDA 12.1

# ===========================
# graph-tool - Advanced Graph Algorithms
# ===========================
# NOT available via pip - requires system-level installation
#
# Installation instructions:
#
# macOS (Homebrew):
#   brew install graph-tool
#
# Ubuntu/Debian:
#   sudo apt-get install python3-graph-tool
#
# Conda:
#   conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool
#
# Docker:
#   Use image: tiagopeixoto/graph-tool
#
# Note: The project works fine WITHOUT graph-tool.
#       It's only needed for advanced graph algorithms.
#       NetworkX provides all essential functionality.

# ===========================
# Other Optional Packages
# ===========================

# GPU-accelerated PyTorch (if you have NVIDIA GPU)
# Install from: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# torch==2.1.2+cu118  # CUDA 11.8 version

# spaCy language models (downloaded separately)
# en_core_web_sm  # English small model
# da_core_news_sm  # Danish small model
# These are installed via: python -m spacy download <model_name>
